# Book Search Engine

## Description
This is a website used to search books from Google and save them to the user's profile using the GraphQL query language and a Mongo Database. This project was created as an assignment for the University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamp and involved converting the application's REST API into GraphQL language.

## Usage
This program requires a connection to a MongoDB database. I use MongoDB Compass to create a local connection. After creating a MongoDB connection to mongodb://localhost:27017/, run npm install to install the dependencies, and then run npm start or npm run develop.

Users must start by registering an account with a username, email, and password. Once logged in, users can search for books using the Google Books API via the search bar. When the desired book is found, users can add it to their list, which can be viewed on the saved books page. Books can also be removed from a user's list.
